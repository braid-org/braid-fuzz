# braid-fuzz

Test framework for braid-http client implementations. Helps you build a new braid-http client that syncs perfectly. Great for guiding an AI.

Run your client through this gauntlet, and get back pass/fail results that an AI agent (or human) can act on.

## Quick start

```
npm install
braid-fuzz serve
```

This starts an HTTP server. Your client connects to it with plain HTTP:

1. `GET http://127.0.0.1:4444/fuzz` — opens a long-lived response streaming JSON-line commands
2. Read the first line to get your `session` ID
3. For each command, send your response as `PUT http://127.0.0.1:4444/fuzz?session=ID`

Tests run automatically when your client connects. See [Protocol](#protocol) below for the full command reference.

You can also spawn your client as a subprocess:

```
braid-fuzz serve "node ./clients/js-simpleton.js"
braid-fuzz serve "node ./clients/js-simpleton.js" -simpleton
braid-fuzz serve "emacs --batch --load ./clients/emacs-agent.el"
```

```

- **Test server** (`server.js`) — wraps `braid-text` with a control API for making server-side edits, reading state, and configuring behavior (ACK delays, PUT drops, etc.)
- **Socket proxy** (`proxy.js`) — TCP proxy between client and server. Supports modes: `passthrough`, `blackhole`, `rst`, `close`, `delay`, `corrupt`. Tests switch modes to simulate network faults.
- **Client bridge** — communicates with the client under test. In server mode (`lib/http-bridge.js`), streams commands over a long-lived GET and receives responses via PUTs. In subprocess mode (`lib/client-bridge.js`), spawns a process and talks JSON-lines over stdin/stdout.
- **Test suites** (`tests/`) — discrete, named tests with structured assertions.

## Test suites

Tests are organized into three layers, from lowest to highest:

### Subscriptions

Tests for braid subscription parsing — the core protocol layer. These use the `subscribe` command to test the client's `braid_fetch` directly, independent of any merge protocol.

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| subscriptions-1 | Receive snapshot body — full body via Content-Length |
| subscriptions-2 | Receive incremental patch — Content-Range patch |
| subscriptions-3 | Multi-patch update — Patches: N with multiple patches |
| subscriptions-4 | Receive Patches: 0 update — version advances, no content |
| subscriptions-5 | Subscribe with Parents header — server resumes from version |
| subscriptions-6 | Receive multiple updates in one stream — ordering verified |

### Reconnects

Tests for reliable reconnection: retry logic, error recovery, fault injection. Uses `subscribe` to test `braid_fetch` reconnection behavior directly.

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| reconnects-1 | Reconnect after connection close |
| reconnects-2 | Reconnect after TCP RST mid-stream |
| reconnects-3 | 503 then recovery — client retries and succeeds |
| reconnects-4 | Rapid disconnect cycling — 3 disconnects, reconnects each time |
| reconnects-5 | Client can unsubscribe — no reconnect after unsubscribe |
| reconnects-6 | 500 then recovery — warn and retry |
| reconnects-7 | Blackhole then disconnect triggers reconnect |
| reconnects-8 | Close between patches — patch applied, then reconnect |
| reconnects-9 | Multiple error statuses then recovery |
| reconnects-10 | Reconnect after connection refused — proxy down then back |

### Simpleton

Tests for the simpleton merge protocol: local edits, remote edits, concurrent convergence. Uses `simpleton` to start a `simpleton_client` and `replace`/`state` to drive edits.

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| simpleton-1 | Initial subscribe — buffer matches server state |
| simpleton-2 | Local edit round-trip — insert → PUT → ACK → states match |
| simpleton-3 | Receive remote edit — server edit arrives in client |
| simpleton-4 | Concurrent edits converge — both sides insert at pos 0 |
| simpleton-5 | Interleaved edits — alternating client/server, all present |
| simpleton-6 | Edit during reconnect — offline edit merges on reconnect |

## Protocol

Your client connects via HTTP and communicates using newline-delimited JSON. No WebSockets, no SSE, no braid framing — just plain HTTP.

### Connecting

1. **`GET /fuzz`** — opens a long-lived chunked response. The first line is a JSON object with a `session` field:

```json
{"session": "abc123"}
```

Save this session ID. All subsequent PUT requests must include it.

2. After the session line, the server streams JSON-line commands (one per line). Each command has an `id` and `cmd` field.

3. **`PUT /fuzz?session=abc123`** — send your response as the PUT body (a single JSON line). You can also pass the session as an `X-Session-Id` header instead of a query parameter.

4. When all tests finish, the server sends a final line with `"done": true` and the results summary, then closes the GET response.

### Example flow

```
Client                                  Fuzz Server
  |                                         |
  |  GET /fuzz                              |
  |  ────────────────────────────────────>  |
  |                                         |
  |  {"session": "abc123"}                  |
  |  <────────────────────────────────────  |
  |  {"id":1, "cmd":"subscribe", "url":..}  |
  |  <────────────────────────────────────  |
  |                                         |
  |  PUT /fuzz?session=abc123               |
  |  Body: {"id":1, "ok":true}              |
  |  ────────────────────────────────────>  |
  |                                         |
  |  (client pushes updates as they arrive) |
  |  PUT /fuzz?session=abc123               |
  |  Body: {"event":"fetch-update", ...}    |
  |  ────────────────────────────────────>  |
  |                                         |
  |  ... more commands ...                  |
  |                                         |
  |  {"done":true, "results":[...], ...}    |
  |  <────────────────────────────────────  |
  |  (GET response ends)                    |
```

### Commands (server → client)

Every command includes an `id` (integer, assigned by the server) and a `cmd` (string). The client must echo back the same `id` in its response.

#### `subscribe` — Start a braid subscription

```json
{"id": 1, "cmd": "subscribe", "url": "http://...", "headers": {"Merge-Type": "simpleton"}}
```

| Field | Type   | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `url` | string | Full HTTP URL to subscribe to |
| `headers` | object | Extra headers to send with the GET request (optional) |

The client should start a `braid_fetch` subscription to the given URL with `subscribe: true`. As updates arrive, the client must **push them proactively** as unsolicited messages (no `id`):

```json
{"event": "fetch-update", "name": "sub-1", "data": {"version": [...], "parents": [...], "body": "...", "patches": [...]}}
```

The `data` object should include:
- `version` — the update's Version header (array of strings, or null)
- `parents` — the update's Parents header (array of strings, or null)
- `body` — the full body text (for snapshot updates)
- `patches` — array of `{range: [start, end], content: "..."}` (for incremental updates)

On errors, push:
```json
{"event": "fetch-error", "name": "sub-1", "data": {"message": "..."}}
```

Used by subscription and reconnect tests.

#### `unsubscribe` — Abort a subscription

```json
{"id": 2, "cmd": "unsubscribe", "name": "sub-1"}
```

Aborts the subscription started by a previous `subscribe` command. If `name` is omitted, aborts the most recent subscription.

#### `simpleton` — Open a simpleton subscription

```json
{"id": 3, "cmd": "simpleton", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:4567/doc"}
```

| Field | Type   | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `url` | string | Full HTTP URL of the braid-text resource to subscribe to |

The client should start a `simpleton_client` (or equivalent) subscription to the given URL, wiring up `on_state` / `get_state` callbacks so the local buffer tracks remote state. Used by simpleton tests.

#### `replace` — Edit the local buffer

```json
{"id": 4, "cmd": "replace", "pos": 3, "len": 2, "text": "x"}
```

| Field  | Type   | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `pos`  | number | 0-based character index (not byte offset). Default: 0 |
| `len`  | number | Number of characters to remove. Default: 0 |
| `text` | string | Text to insert at `pos` after removing. Default: "" |

Mutates the local buffer and triggers a PUT to the server (via `simpleton.changed()` or equivalent). Covers insert (`len: 0`), delete (`text: ""`), and replace.

#### `state` — Return the current buffer contents

```json
{"id": 7, "cmd": "state"}
```

Response **must** include a `state` field:

```json
{"id": 7, "ok": true, "state": "current buffer text"}
```

#### `wait-ack` — Block until all pending PUTs are acknowledged

```json
{"id": 8, "cmd": "wait-ack"}
```

The client must not respond until every previously triggered PUT has received an ACK from the server. If there are no pending PUTs, respond immediately.

#### `kill-sub` — Tear down the active simpleton subscription

```json
{"id": 9, "cmd": "kill-sub"}
```

Aborts the current simpleton subscription. Does **not** clear the local buffer.

#### `quit` — Shut down the client process

```json
{"id": 10, "cmd": "quit"}
```

The client should respond, clean up resources, and exit.

### Responses (client → runner)

Every response is a single JSON line containing the `id` from the command.

**Success:**
```json
{"id": 1, "ok": true}
```

**Success with data** (only `state` returns extra fields):
```json
{"id": 7, "ok": true, "state": "buffer contents here"}
```

**Error:**
```json
{"id": 1, "error": "description of what went wrong"}
```

**Unsolicited events** (no `id` — pushed proactively by the client):
```json
{"event": "fetch-update", "name": "sub-1", "data": {...}}
{"event": "fetch-error", "name": "sub-1", "data": {"message": "..."}}
```

### Writing a new client

Connect to the fuzz server with a long-lived GET and send responses via PUT. Any language with an HTTP client can do this. Key points:

- All positions are **character offsets**, not byte offsets (relevant for multi-byte UTF-8).
- Handle commands sequentially (respond to each before reading the next) except for `wait-ack`, which blocks until ACKs arrive.
- For `subscribe` commands, push updates proactively as unsolicited events — don't wait to be asked.
- Unknown commands should return an error response, not crash.

See [clients/js-simpleton.js](clients/js-simpleton.js) for a complete reference implementation.

## CLI

```
braid-fuzz serve                          Start HTTP server, wait for client
braid-fuzz serve <cmd>                    Spawn <cmd> as subprocess, run tests
braid-fuzz serve <cmd> -<pattern>         Run only tests matching pattern
braid-fuzz client <cmd|url>               (coming soon) Test a braid server

Options:
  -<pattern>            Filter tests (e.g. -reconnects, -simpleton, -subscriptions-1)
  --port <n>            Fuzz server port (default: 4444, server mode only)
  --timeout <ms>        Per-test timeout (default: 30000)
  --json                Output results as JSON
  --server-port <n>     Fixed braid-text server port (default: auto)
  --proxy-port <n>      Fixed proxy port (default: auto)
```

In server mode, you can also pass a filter via query string: `GET /fuzz?filter=simpleton`

## JSON output

The final line of the GET response (with `"done": true`) contains the full results:

```json
{
  "done": true,
  "results": [
    {"id": "subscriptions-1", "name": "Receive snapshot body", "status": "pass", "duration_ms": 521},
    {"id": "simpleton-4", "name": "Concurrent edits converge", "status": "fail", "error": "...", "duration_ms": 10032}
  ],
  "summary": {"passed": 21, "failed": 1, "skipped": 0, "total": 22}
}
```

## Subprocess mode

In subprocess mode, the client reads JSON-line commands from stdin and writes JSON-line responses to stdout. The commands, responses, and unsolicited events are identical to server mode.

```
braid-fuzz serve "node ./clients/js-simpleton.js"
braid-fuzz serve "node ./clients/js-simpleton.js" -simpleton
braid-fuzz serve "node ./clients/js-simpleton.js" --json
```

In this mode, diagnostic output must go to **stderr** (stdout is the protocol channel).
